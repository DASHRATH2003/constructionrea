# Construction Service Videos

This directory contains video files for the COBRIXA construction website's service video showcase.

## Video Files

1. `residential-construction.mp4` - Showcases residential construction projects
2. `commercial-construction.mp4` - Showcases commercial building projects
3. `industrial-construction.mp4` - Showcases industrial facility projects
4. `renovation-services.mp4` - Showcases renovation and remodeling services

## Video Sources

For the actual implementation, you should replace these placeholder videos with high-quality construction videos that showcase your specific services. You can obtain construction videos from:

1. Your own project footage
2. Stock video services like Shutterstock, Adobe Stock, or Videvo
3. Commissioned professional videography of your construction projects

## Video Specifications

For optimal performance on the website, videos should:

- Be in MP4 format (H.264 codec)
- Have a resolution of 1280x720 or 1920x1080
- Be compressed for web delivery (target 5-10 MB per minute of video)
- Be 30-60 seconds in length for each service showcase
- Include proper licensing for any stock footage used

## Implementation Notes

The videos are displayed in the ServiceVideos component and are loaded only when a user clicks on a service card, improving initial page load performance.
